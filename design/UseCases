Use Case: User can map to account(s) as defined in a text file.

1) Admin specifies the text file to use for account mapping.
   A) Admin modifies config file, adds 'map_file <path>'
   B) Pam modules reads option in on next instantiation.
   C) If the option does not exist or is not parseable, an error message
      is generated and sent to syslog and authentication fails.
2) Admin may specifiy one or both idp_suffix and map_file.
   A) If at least one option is not specified, an error is generated.
3) Admin may only specify map_file zero or once; additional use of the config
   option is ignored.
4) Admin populates the map file one account mapping per line. Each line
   consists of an Auth identity username or Auth identity id followed by
   a local account name. The map file contains no sections.
5) On user login, the map file is loaded if map_file was configured.
   A) map file format violations are reported as errors via syslog
6) On user login, if idp_suffix is also specified, both methods are used,
   neither is given priority and ordering is not defined.
7) User logs in as 'globus-mapping'
   A) Pam module reports local account names mapped to with Auth identity id
      or Auth identity usernames associated with the user's linked accounts
   B) Each mapped account is listed only once.
   C) Authentication fails
   D) If the file does not exist or is not parseable, an error msg is sent to
      syslog and authentication fails.
8) User specifies account other than 'globus-mapping'
   A) specified account matches mapping associated with one of the user's
      linked identities. Authentication succeeds.
   B) specified account does not match any mapped account. Authentication fails.
   C) If the file does not exist or is not parseable, an error msg is sent to
      syslog and authentication fails.
