pam-oauth2 is a clone of https://github.com/zalando-incubator/pam-oauth2.git with modifications to work with our token introspection.

It still needs user mapping design (will currently only work if the globus username is also a local account.

The introspection work should be moved into a seperate lib for possible reuse.
